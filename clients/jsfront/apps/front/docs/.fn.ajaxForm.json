This method will include the submit element's name/value data (for the element that was\n\tused to submit the form).\n 3. This method binds the submit() method to the form for you.\n\n The options argument for ajaxForm works exactly as it does for ajaxSubmit.  ajaxForm merely\n passes the options argument along after properly binding events for submit elements and\n the form itself.\n \n", "tags": undefined})
